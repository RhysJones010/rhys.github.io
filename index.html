                <div class="col-8">
                    <p> My name is Rhys Jones. I am 19 years old and I'm from County Cork.<br>
                        I am currently studying Music, Media and Performance technology at the University of Limerick.<br>
                        I chose to study this course as I have a love for producing music and I'm also interested in aspects of the course such as programming and film.<br>
                        I produce electronic music under the name "<a href="https://soundcloud.com/glucose-883655445" target="_blank">Glucose</a>". <br>
                        In the future I would hope that I could make a career out of producing and performing music, as well as recording and mixing for other artists.<br>
                        Myself and my girlfriend, Orlanne started a band in 2023 called "The Nits".
                        I have recently started making visual art using the software TouchDesigner which handles real-time visuals but can also be used for photos.

                    <h2>Skills & Interests</h2>
                    <p>I have a deep interest in audio-visuals and sound design.<br>
                        I have been playing the drums for 7 years and I have an interest in forming a band to play with other musicians.<br>
                        I'm interested in the field of graphic design and I have recently started developing my skills in this field.<br>
                        I would like to learn how to record live music in the future and how to mix and master tracks.

            <p>
                In the future, I hope to release an album and perform electronic music live. Artists such as Aphex Twin inspire me to create music.<br>
                My hobbies of music production and visuals connect to my ambitions as I want to release my work and perform live.<br>
                As part of my "music and computers" module, we had an assignment where we had to perform live by triggering clips in the music software "Ableton". This project really inspired me to continue to work on music.

            <h2>Reflection & Future Plan</h2>
            <p>
                I think that this page is a decent representation for my current self. If I were to expand this site, I would add a separate page exclusively for visual art that I have created.<br>
                If I gained more web development skills, I would like to add a section where videos and music that I have created could be played.
